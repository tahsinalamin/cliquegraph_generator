# cliquegraph_generator
A program that generates a graph with cliques of different sizes and shapes.

How to run the program: "python3 graph_clique_generator.py method=linear/geometric shape=tree/cyclic"

Selecting method=linear will generate clique sizes like 1,2,3... and selecting method=geometric will generate clique sizes like 2,4,8...

shape=tree means the cliques will be interconnected with a tree shape and shape=cyclic means cliques will be interconnected with a cycle.
